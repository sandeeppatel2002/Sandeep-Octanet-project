# Task/Project-1 (Landing Page)

Link: https://utkarshrajput7.github.io/OCTANET_JUNE/Task1(Landing%20Page)/

This project is basically a landing page. 

I have made this landing page for the website of a company called "CricKIT". 
This company is nothing but my assumption. *CricKIT is basically an online store for all the products used in Cricket(bats,balls,pads,helmet,stumps,etc.)*

While making this project, I have used HTML for structure, CSS for styling and "style.css" for adding animations.
Images used are from either "pinterest.com" or google images.
